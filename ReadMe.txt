Asumptions taken:
1. That before you run the code, you will create a database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio with the name "NumberLists" and run a "Update-Database" statement in the Package Manager Console
2. That you can not enter multiple int's at the same time
3. That when you want to see the full list of lists with numbers you will look at them in the Json format
